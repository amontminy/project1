1. What did you like about this website?

I really liked the way you did the title and tabs section of your website it is clear to look at and navigate. Your animation was well tied into being able to change into the contact form. I also liked the use of the hyperlink to whirlpools website it was a nice touch.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
    Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?

I would say theyre pretty close in terms of user experience, same banner across the top and navigation similar request form and overall setup. I think they are also similar in maintainability.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    if not, suggest some specific improvements

Most of the html is in just the home directory but the images are very well organized.

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    were semantically appropriate elements selected
    is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?

I didnt see any blatant issues as far as my eyes were concerned.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

Keep doing what youre doing, I think the website turned out great and it was very nice to do a code review for you.
